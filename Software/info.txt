<h1>Installing image onto SD card for Raspberry PI</h1>

<h2>Windows</h2>
1) Format drive to FAT32 <br>
Note: Since windows can't see the OS partition, a 3rd party software solution is required for this. <br>
I recommend the free program MiniTool Partition Wizard: http://www.partitionwizard.com/download.html <br>

2) Install image to SD card (Again need a 3rd party software solution) <br>
-For this I recommend the free software tool Win32 Disk Manager:http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

<h2>Linux</h2>
